# Open Data and Commercial Data

## Data Comparison

| Data Type | Components | User Permissions | Content |
|-----------|------------|-----------------|---------|
| Open Data | Processes, Flows, Flow Properties, Unit Groups, Sources, Contacts, Models | View/Reference | Standardized life cycle assessment datasets reviewed by the platform |
| Commercial Data | Processes, Flows, Flow Properties, Unit Groups, Sources, Contacts | View | Metadata information (descriptive information) of commercial life cycle assessment datasets |

>Note:  
Both types of data **do not support direct modification**. If you need to adjust data information, you must first save the target data to the ["My Data"](./create-my-data.md) module, then make modifications, and then reference it in the ["My Data"](./create-my-data.md) module.

>Note:  
You must update the version number before saving. The system will verify the uniqueness of the version number, and duplicate version numbers will be rejected.
